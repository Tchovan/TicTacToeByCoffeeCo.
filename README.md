An exhilarating game of Tic Tac Toe for your entertainment.

This game is a traditional game of Tic Tac Toe. It is played in an IDE console.
The game starts via the function main(String args[]) in Main.java.

A player chooses a space by typing a corresponding number 1-9 as follows:

-------------
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
-------------
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
-------------
| 7 | 8 | 9 |
-------------

The first player will be assigned 'X' and the second player will be assigned 'O'. No further players
or symbols are allowed.
Players go back and forth choosing a space until a player has gotten 3 X's in a row, 3 O's in a row,
or the spaces fill up in a tie game.
If either player provides an out of bounds input, ( <1 or >9 ), then the player will be asked
to provide an input again.
The game ends when a player wins or the game is a draw.
The user must re-run the game to play again.


Code is in Java ~~ two classes:
Main: Handles initiation of the game and controls game flow.
Board: Handles creation of the board and controls game logic.

Thanks for playing!
